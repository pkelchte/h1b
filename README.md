# H-1B
Collection of information regarding the H-1B (specialty occupation) visa application/transfer.

This document is specific to entry level Electrical Engineers in the Los Angeles County (Area Code: 31084). H-1B benificiaries of other occupations in other regions should use the [FLC Data Center wizard](http://www.flcdatacenter.com/OESWizardStart.aspx) to obtain data proper for their prospective job.

# Application Process and Costs

- Step 1: Employer submits Labor Condition Application (LCA) to Department Of Labor (DOL) for certification. This happens online and is free.
- Step 2: Employer submits a completed Form I-129 to USCIS  by paper. This costs $325 + applicable fees of up to $2000.
The DOL-certified LCA from Step 1. must be submitted with the Form I-129.
- Step 3: Prospective Workers Outside the United States Apply for Visa and/or Admission.

## Step 1. Labor Condition Approval approval with DOL -- (online, $0)

On the [iCERT Visa Portal System](https://icert.doleta.gov/), the company representative must log in or create an Employer Account and select *LCA Visa Program*.

Once logged in, a new ETA Form 9035E has to be started. Required fields are marked with *, optional fields with §.

Form Access Preconditions have to be filled in with *Yes, Yes, Either*, before the actual form can be filled. Instructions for the form are found in [Form 9035CP](9035CP.pdf) or in the [User Guide](iCERT_LCA_Mod_External_User_Guide.pdf).

All data in this form is straightforward (point of contact at company, Federal Employer Identification, NAICS code, ...) except for the following bits. I compiled the information for my situation in March 2016. Additional tips by the DOL are available in [this document](Employer-Filing-Tips_March 2016-03092016-063430.pdf)
