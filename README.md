# H-1B
Collection of information regarding the H-1B (specialty occupation) visa application/transfer.

This document is specific to entry level Electrical Engineers in the Los Angeles County (Area Code: 31084). H-1B benificiaries of other occupations in other regions should use the [FLC Data Center wizard](http://www.flcdatacenter.com/OESWizardStart.aspx) to obtain data proper for their prospective job.

# Application Process

- Step 1: Employer Submits Labor Condition Application (LCA) to Department Of Labor for certification (DOL).
- Step 2: Employer Submits Completed Form I-129 to USCIS.
The employer should file Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, with the correct USCIS Service Center. The DOL-certified LCA must be submitted with the Form I-129.
- Step 3 (only at first application): Prospective Workers Outside the United States Apply for Visa and/or Admission.

## Step 1. LCA to DOL
All data in this form is straightforward (point of contact at company, Federal Employer Identification, NAICS code, ...) except for the following bits. I compiled the information for my situation in March 2016.

Instructions for the form are found in [Form 9035CP](9035CP.pdf)
