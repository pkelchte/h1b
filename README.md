Some history: I was feeling lucky in the beginning of this year and attempted an H1B visa transfer without consulting any paid advisors. I read through the law texts referred to below, compiled instructions, and successfully helped my new employer file my case with USCIS.

We filed -closely following these instructions- at the end of March 2016, got a Receipt Notice within days, next came an Approval Notice in December. If your visa situation is uncomplicated, you can definitely do it too!

# H-1B Change of Employer
Collection of information regarding the H-1B (specialty occupation) visa transfer, assuming the simplest case (beneficiary will work at the company's main office, there is no [EAR](http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/regulations/export-administration-regulations-ear#ccl)/ITAR data they will have access to, and the company is not H-1B dependent)

Also, the codes and salaries in this document are specific to entry level Electrical Engineers in the Los Angeles County (Area Code: 31084). H-1B workers with other occupations in other regions should use the [FLC Data Center wizard](http://www.flcdatacenter.com/OESWizardStart.aspx) to obtain data for their prospective job.

# Application Process

1. Employer submits Labor Condition Application (LCA) to Department Of Labor (DOL) for certification
This happens online and is free.
2. Employer submits a completed Form I-129 with additional evidence to USCIS. The DOL-certified LCA from 1. must be included.
This happens by mail. The total filing fee is $2325, additional details about deducting this business expense to the worker are found below.

As soon as the package in 2. is submitted, the H-1B worker can start employment with the new employer.

The H-1B worker can reenter the country with the original H-1B visa and stamp in their passport as long as that visa is not expired. The new Form I-797 however needs to be presented.

## Step 1. Labor Condition Approval approval with DOL -- (online, $0)

On the [iCERT Visa Portal System](https://icert.doleta.gov/), the company representative must log in or create an Employer Account and select *LCA Visa Program*.

Once logged in, a new ETA Form 9035E has to be started. Required fields are marked with *, optional fields with §.

Form Access Preconditions have to be filled in with *Yes, Yes, Either*, before the actual form can be filled. Instructions for the form are found in [Form 9035CP](9035CP.pdf) or in the [User Guide](iCERT_LCA_Mod_External_User_Guide.pdf).

All data in this form is straightforward (point of contact at company, Federal Employer Identification, NAICS code, ...) except for the following bits. I compiled the information for my situation in March 2016. Additional tips by the DOL are available in [this document](Employer-Filing-Tips_March 2016-03092016-063430.pdf)

#### a. Subsection 1
- 1. No
- 2. No
- 3. N/A

#### b. Subsection 2
- leave blank

## Step 2. Form I-129 and additional evidence USCIS ($325 + $500 + $1500)

Form I-129 has to be filled in, and for H-1B workers, additional evidence has to be compiled so the government official can verify the following 5 requirements.

1. There is an employer-employee relationship with the petitioner
2. The job must qualify as a specialty occupation
3. The beneficiary must qualify for that job
4. The benificiary must be paid at least the prevailing wage
5. The employer is liable for reasonable costs of return transportation at dismissal before the end of the visa

### Filling in I-129 and attachments
Do not forget to sign with **BLUE INK** the following three parts of the form. This to readily identify the original signature.

#### I-129

Basis for classification: e. Change of employer.

Requested action: c. Extend the stay of each beneficiary because the beneficiary(ies) now hold(s) this status.

[Dot Code](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/eta_form_9035cp_appendix_i_121908.pdf) for Electrical Engineers: 003

From the [USCIS Adjudicator's Field Manual](https://www.uscis.gov/iframe/ilink/docView/AFM/HTML/AFM/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-13593.html):

#### 1. Employer-employee relationship
The petitioner must clearly show that an employer-employee relationship will exist between the petitioner and beneficiary, and establish that the employer has the right to control the beneficiary’s work, including the ability to hire, fire and supervise the beneficiary. The petitioner must also be responsible for the overall direction of the beneficiary’s work. The above elements should continue to exist throughout the duration of the requested H-1B validity period. The petitioner can demonstrate an employer-employee relationship by providing a combination of the following or similar types of evidence:

- Copy of signed Employment Agreement between the petitioner and beneficiary detailing the terms and conditions of employment; 
- Copy of an employment offer letter that clearly describes the nature of the employer-employee relationship and the services to be performed by the beneficiary;
- Copy of position description that describes the skills required to perform the job offered, the source of the instrumentalities and tools needed to perform the job, the product to be developed or the service to be provided and whether that is part of the regular business of the petitioner, the location where the beneficiary will work, the duration of the relationship between the petitioner and beneficiary, whether the petitioner has the right to assign additional duties, the extent of petitioner’s discretion over when and how long the beneficiary will work, the method of payment, the petitioner’s role in paying and hiring assistants to be utilized by the beneficiary, the provision of employee benefits, and the tax treatment of the beneficiary in relation to the petitioner; 
- A description of the performance review process; and/or
- Copy of petitioner’s organizational chart, demonstrating beneficiary’s supervisory chain.

#### 2. Specialty Occupation
It must be shown that the position meets one of the following criteria:

1. A baccalaureate or higher degree or its equivalent is normally the minimum requirement for entry into the particular position;
2. The degree requirement is common to the industry in parallel positions among similar organizations or, an employer may show that its particular position is so complex or unique that it can be performed only by an individual with a degree;
3. The employer normally requires a degree or its equivalent for the position;
4. The nature of the specific duties are so specialized and complex that knowledge required to perform the duties is usually associated with the attainment of a baccalaureate or higher degree.

#### 3. Beneficiary Qualification
Evidence must be submitted to show that the alien is qualified to perform services in a specialty occupation.

##### School records, diplomas, degrees
It must be shown that the alien:

1. Holds a United States baccalaureate or higher degree required by the specialty occupation from an accredited college or university;
2. Holds a foreign degree determined to be equivalent to a United States baccalaureate or higher degree required by the specialty occupation from an accredited college or university. This by evaluation of education by a reliable credentials evaluation service which specializes in evaluating foreign educational credentials

##### Affidavits, declarations
Affidavits submitted by present or former employers or recognized authorities certifying the recognition and expertise of the beneficiary shall specifically describe the beneficiary's recognition and ability in factual terms. They must set forth the expertise of the affiant and the manner in which the affiant acquired such information.

Such writing must state:
1. The writer's qualifications as an expert; 
2. The writer's experience giving such opinions, citing specific instances where past opinions have been accepted as authoritative and by whom; 
3. How the conclusions were reached; and 
4. The basis for the conclusions supported by copies or citations of any research material used.

#### 4. Prevailing wage

2. A certification from the Secretary of Labor that the petitioner has filed a labor condition application with the Secretary,
3. A statement that it will comply with the terms of the labor condition application for the duration of the alien's authorized period of stay,

#### 5. Return costs
Written confirmation acknowledging the liability for transportation costs.

The employer will be liable for the reasonable costs of return transportation of the alien abroad if the alien is dismissed from employment by the employer before the end of the period of authorized admission.

### Filing fees payable by check
There are three fees: the I-129 fee, the Fraud detection and prevention fee, and the ACWIA fee. The American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) Fee is a training fee meant to fund the training of U.S. workers. If the employer has fewer than 25 full-time employees, they must pay only one-half of the required fee.

**According to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) [DOL WHD Fact Sheet  #62H](http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/FactSheet62/whdfs62H.pdf), an H-1B worker can never be required to pay any part of the ACWIA and Fraud detection and prevention fees. Attorney fees and filing fees for Form I-129 can be deducted as long as they don't reduce an H-1B worker’s pay below the required wage rate.**

All checks and money orders must be drawn on U.S. financial institutions and made payable in U.S. funds to **U.S. Department of Homeland Security** (not "USDHS" or "DHS").

#### Check 1
U.S. Department of Homeland Security - $325.00 - Form I-129

#### Check 2
U.S. Department of Homeland Security - $500.00 - Fraud Detection and Prevention Fee

#### Check 3
U.S. Department of Homeland Security - $1500.00 - ACWIA fee
