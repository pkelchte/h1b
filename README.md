# H-1B
Collection of information regarding the H-1B (specialty occupation) visa transfer, assuming the simplest case (beneficiary will work at the company's main office, there is no [EAR](http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/regulations/export-administration-regulations-ear#ccl)/ITAR data they will have access to, and the company is not H-1B dependent)

Also, the codes and salaries in this document are specific to entry level Electrical Engineers in the Los Angeles County (Area Code: 31084). H-1B benificiaries of other occupations in other regions should use the [FLC Data Center wizard](http://www.flcdatacenter.com/OESWizardStart.aspx) to obtain data for their prospective job.

# Application Process

1. Employer submits Labor Condition Application (LCA) to Department Of Labor (DOL) for certification
This happens online and is free.
2. Employer submits a completed Form I-129 with additional evidence to USCIS. The DOL-certified LCA from 1. must be included.
This happens by mail. The total filing fee is $2325, additional details about deducting this business expense to the worker are found below.

As soon as the package in 2. is submitted, the H-1B worker can start employment with the new employer.

## Step 1. Labor Condition Approval approval with DOL -- (online, $0)

On the [iCERT Visa Portal System](https://icert.doleta.gov/), the company representative must log in or create an Employer Account and select *LCA Visa Program*.

Once logged in, a new ETA Form 9035E has to be started. Required fields are marked with *, optional fields with §.

Form Access Preconditions have to be filled in with *Yes, Yes, Either*, before the actual form can be filled. Instructions for the form are found in [Form 9035CP](9035CP.pdf) or in the [User Guide](iCERT_LCA_Mod_External_User_Guide.pdf).

All data in this form is straightforward (point of contact at company, Federal Employer Identification, NAICS code, ...) except for the following bits. I compiled the information for my situation in March 2016. Additional tips by the DOL are available in [this document](Employer-Filing-Tips_March 2016-03092016-063430.pdf)

From the [USCIS Adjudicator's Field Manual](https://www.uscis.gov/iframe/ilink/docView/AFM/HTML/AFM/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-13593.html):

#### 1. Employer-employee relationship
With contracts or offer letters, the petitioner must show a combination of the following:

- The beneficiary works at an office location owned/leased by the petitioner,
- the beneficiary reports directly to the petitioner on a daily basis,
- the petitioner sets the work schedule of the beneficiary,
- the beneficiary uses the petitioner’s tools/instrumentalities to perform the duties of employment,
- the petitioner directly reviews the work-product of the beneficiary.
- The petitioner claims the beneficiary for tax purposes and provides medical benefits to the beneficiary.

#### 2. Specialty Occupation
With writing by an expert in the field, or other forms of documentation, it must be shown that the position meets one of the following criteria:

1. A baccalaureate or higher degree or its equivalent is normally the minimum requirement for entry into the particular position;
2. The degree requirement is common to the industry in parallel positions among similar organizations or, an employer may show that its particular position is so complex or unique that it can be performed only by an individual with a degree;
3. The employer normally requires a degree or its equivalent for the position;
4. The nature of the specific duties are so specialized and complex that knowledge required to perform the duties is usually associated with the attainment of a baccalaureate or higher degree.

#### 3. Beneficiary Qualification
School records, diplomas, degrees, affidavits, declarations, contracts, and similar documentation bust be submitted to show that the alien meets one of the following criteria:

1. Hold a United States baccalaureate or higher degree required by the specialty occupation from an accredited college or university;
2. Hold a foreign degree determined to be equivalent to a United States baccalaureate or higher degree required by the specialty occupation from an accredited college or university. This by evaluation of education by a reliable credentials evaluation service which specializes in evaluating foreign educational credentials

#### 4. Prevailing wage
Attach all three:

1. Copies of any written contracts between the petitioner and beneficiary, or a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under which the beneficiary will be employed, if there is no written contract.
2. A certification from the Secretary of Labor that the petitioner has filed a labor condition application with the Secretary,
3. A statement that it will comply with the terms of the labor condition application for the duration of the alien's authorized period of stay,

#### 5. Return costs
Written confirmation acknowledging the liability for transportation costs.

The employer will be liable for the reasonable costs of return transportation of the alien abroad if the alien is dismissed from employment by the employer before the end of the period of authorized admission.

### Filling in I-129 and attachments
Sign preferably with dark blue ink.

#### I-129
[Dot Code](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/eta_form_9035cp_appendix_i_121908.pdf) for Electrical Engineers: 003

#### H Classification Supplement to Form I-129

#### H-1B and H-1B1 Data Collection and Filing Fee Exemption Supplement


### Additional evidence
Beneficiary’s last 2 pay stubs, Form W-2, as well as a copy of the beneficiary’s Form I-94, passport, travel document, or I-797.

### Filing fees payable by check
There are three fees: the I-129 fee, the Fraud detection and prevention fee, and the ACWIA fee. The American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) Fee is a training fee meant to fund the training of U.S. workers. If the employer has fewer than 25 full-time employees, they must pay only one-half of the required fee.

**According to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) [DOL WHD Fact Sheet  #62H](http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/FactSheet62/whdfs62H.pdf), an H-1B worker can never be required to pay any part of the ACWIA and Fraud detection and prevention fees. Attorney fees and filing fees for ETA 9035 and Form I-129 can be deducted as long as they don't reduce an H-1B worker’s pay below the required wage rate.**

All checks and money orders must be drawn on U.S. financial institutions and made payable in U.S. funds to **U.S. Department of Homeland Security** (not "USDHS" or "DHS").

#### Check 1
U.S. Department of Homeland Security - $325.00 - Form I-129

#### Check 2
U.S. Department of Homeland Security - $500.00 - Fraud Detection and Prevention Fee

#### Check 3
U.S. Department of Homeland Security - $1500.00 - ACWIA fee
